This page serves as a scratch-pad for ideas to go into future versions. None of these are promised, or even well-though-through.

  * *Mark file items that are default vs. required*
    If there were some sort of marking system then some of the items could be marked as required (and the old item moved out of the way), whereas others could be marked as default only (only copy it if nothing exists at that spot).

  * *Create a method to programatically configure plists*
    This would allow more complex plist handling such as searching through plsit arrays for items. Ideally this would have properties similar to XSLT transformations (working on items based on sub-item searches), while still allowing programatic editing and value generation (ie: the first letter of the user name). My thinking on this is that using JavaScript for this might provide with the best means of sandboxing this work.
